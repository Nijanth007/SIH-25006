## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to build a Smart Grievance Portal that allows citizens to submit complaints online. The system will auto-classify complaints, route them to the correct department, and provide a real-time tracking system for citizens. This ensures faster resolution and transparency in government services.

## Technical Approach
The technical approach involves creating a web application with a backend API and a frontend interface. Complaints will be collected through forms, processed using an auto-classification system (like ML/NLP), stored in a database, and displayed on dashboards for both citizens and department officials. The system uses secure authentication and scalable infrastructure to handle many users simultaneously.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility: The solution is technically feasible using modern frameworks like FastAPI for backend, React for frontend, and PostgreSQL for database. Operational feasibility exists as citizens can easily use the portal.
Viability: Economically viable since it reduces manual processing, saves time, and can be scaled for nationwide usage. Departments benefit from better tracking and 


## Impact and Benefits
The solution improves citizen satisfaction, transparency, and department efficiency. It ensures faster resolution of complaints, provides real-time tracking, enables data-driven decision-making, and supports multi-language access for wider reach.
